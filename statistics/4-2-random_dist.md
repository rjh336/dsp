[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> While the distributions for PMF and CDF are approximately uniform (CDF is nearly a straight line), the functions will only approach continuous uniformity as the sample of random values increases.
>> See plots of PMF and CDF [here](notebooks/chap04ex.ipynb#ch4ex2).
