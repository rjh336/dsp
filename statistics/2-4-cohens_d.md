[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Cohen's d = -0.089, which is to say the difference in means is -0.089 standard deviations.  
>> An absolute difference in means less than 0.2 indicates that the difference between means is small.  
>> In this case, we cannot say that the being firstborn has a small effect size on birth weight.
